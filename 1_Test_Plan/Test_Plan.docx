 1. Introduction

This Test Plan outlines the strategy, scope, resources, and schedule for testing the eLearning Platform. The purpose of this document is to define testing activities to ensure the system meets its requirements and functions correctly.

 2. Scope of Testing *(From SRS Chapter 1.1)*

The eLearning Platform enables students and instructors to interact with learning materials, manage courses, and track progress. Key features to be tested include:

* User registration, login, and role-based access
* Course creation, browsing, and enrollment
* Certificate generation upon completion
* Online payments and user notifications
* Admin dashboard management

Testing will cover functional, non-functional, API, and performance aspects.

 3. Features to be Tested *(From Chapter 1.2 – Modules)*

* User Module – Registration, login, role assignment
* Courses Module – Course creation, categorization, upload of resources
* Enrollment Module – Course listing, enrollment process
* Payment Module – Online payment via JazzCash, Easypaisa, cards
* Certificate Generation Module – Automated certificate creation

---

 4. User Roles & Characteristics *(From Chapter 2.2)*

* Admin: Manages courses, teachers, and overall platform operations.
* Instructor: Creates and manages course content and tracks student progress.
* Student: Registers, enrolls, watches videos, completes quizzes, and receives certificates.

Each user role will be tested for its respective access and functionality.
